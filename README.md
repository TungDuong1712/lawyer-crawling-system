## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Start the System
```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repository-url>
cd lawyer-crawling-system
docker compose up --build

# Run migrations
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Setup Source Configurations
```bash
# Setup LawInfo (62 URLs, 40 selectors: 13 list + 27 detail)
docker compose exec web python manage.py setup_lawinfo

# Setup SuperLawyers (60 URLs, 34 selectors: 12 list + 22 detail)
docker compose exec web python manage.py setup_superlawyers
```

### Step 3: Configure RocketReach API
```bash
# Set RocketReach API key in environment
export ROCKETREACH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Or add to docker-compose.yml environment section
```

### Step 4: Start Crawling
```bash
# Access admin interface to start crawling
# http://localhost:8001/admin/crawler/sourceconfiguration/
```

### Step 5: Access Admin Interface
- **Admin**: http://localhost:8001/admin/
- **Source Configurations**: http://localhost:8001/admin/crawler/sourceconfiguration/
- **Lawyers**: http://localhost:8001/admin/lawyers/lawyer/
- **RocketReach Lookups**: http://localhost:8001/admin/lawyers/rocketreachlookup/

### Step 6: Start Email Discovery
```bash
# Start RocketReach email lookup for lawyers
# Use admin interface: Lawyers -> Select lawyers -> "Lookup emails with RocketReach"
```

### Step 6b: Orchestrated Crawl + Lookup Flow (New)
```bash
# Trigger end-to-end workflow for a session (crawl listings then RocketReach lookups)
docker compose exec web python manage.py start_crawl_workflow <SESSION_ID> --lookup-limit 1000

# Example
docker compose exec web python manage.py start_crawl_workflow 1 --lookup-limit 500
```

### Step 6c: RocketReach Web Automation (Playwright) (New)
Requirements:
- Set credentials via env vars: `ROCKETREACH_EMAIL`, `ROCKETREACH_PASSWORD` (or use hardcoded credentials)
- Uses Microsoft's official Playwright Docker image for better compatibility

**Note**: If you encounter font/dependency issues with the original Dockerfile, the system automatically uses `Dockerfile.playwright` which is based on Microsoft's official Playwright image.

Test login first:
```bash
# Test login only (headed mode to see what happens)
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_api "test" --test-login --headed

# Test login in headless mode
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_api "test" --test-login
```

Run a web lookup by keyword (opens person search and clicks "Get Contact Info"):
```bash
# Synchronous execution (immediate results)
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_api "jayson shaw"

# Debug with visible browser
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_api "jayson shaw" --headed

# Run as Celery task (async)
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_api "jayson shaw" --async
```

**Note**: If login requires MFA/captcha, check the debug screenshots saved to `/tmp/` directory.

### Step 7: Check Results
```bash
# View crawled lawyers with email data
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.lawyers.models import Lawyer, RocketReachLookup
print(f'Total lawyers: {Lawyer.objects.count()}')
print(f'Lawyers with emails: {Lawyer.objects.exclude(email=\"\").count()}')
print(f'RocketReach lookups: {RocketReachLookup.objects.count()}')
print(f'Successful lookups: {RocketReachLookup.objects.filter(status=\"found\").count()}')
"
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### SourceConfiguration Model
SourceConfiguration defines crawling behavior with start URLs and selectors:

#### Configuration Fields
- **Basic Info**: name, description, status, created_by
- **Start URLs**: List of URLs to crawl (e.g., `["www.lawinfo.com/personal-injury/arizona/chandler/"]`)
- **Selectors**: JSON field with structured selectors:
  - `list`: Selectors for listing pages (basic lawyer info)
  - `detail`: Selectors for detail pages (comprehensive info)
- **Crawling Settings**: delay_between_requests, max_retries, timeout
- **Progress Tracking**: total_urls, crawled_urls, success_count, error_count, progress_percentage

#### Selector Structure
```json
{
  "list": {
    "lawyer_name": "//h2[@class='listing-details-header']//a",
    "phone": "//a[@class='directory_phone']//span",
    "detail_url": "//a[@class='directory_profile']/@href"
  },
  "detail": {
    "firm_name": "//h1[@class='org listing-details-header']",
    "address": "//p[@class='listing-desc-address']",
    "attorney_name": "//h4[contains(text(), 'Attorney')]"
  }
}
```


#### Domain-Specific Settings
The system supports domain-specific configurations:

#### LawInfo Domain
- **31 states** with **61 cities**
- **6 practice areas**: personal-injury, car-accident, immigration, bankruptcy, family-law, drunk-driving
- **URL pattern**: `https://www.lawinfo.com/{practice_area}/{state}/{city}/`

#### SuperLawyers Domain
- **6 states** with **4 cities per state**
- **6 practice areas**: business-litigation, personal-injury, criminal-defense, family-law, employment-law, real-estate-law
- **URL pattern**: `https://attorneys.superlawyers.com/{practice_area}/{state}/{city}/`

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DB_NAME=lawyers_db
DB_USER=crawler
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# Celery
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0

# RocketReach API
ROCKETREACH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 📈 Usage

### Email Discovery Workflow

1. **Crawl Lawyer Data**: Use admin interface to start crawling
2. **Email Lookup**: Select lawyers and run "Lookup emails with RocketReach"
3. **Review Results**: Check RocketReach Lookups for discovered emails
4. **Export Data**: Use "Download Lawyers with Emails" to export CSV

### Management Commands

#### Create Source Configuration
```bash
# Quick setup with full configuration (recommended)
docker compose exec web python manage.py setup_lawinfo

# Quick setup for SuperLawyers
docker compose exec web python manage.py setup_superlawyers

# List existing configurations
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.crawler.models import SourceConfiguration
configs = SourceConfiguration.objects.all()
for config in configs:
    print(f'ID: {config.id}, Name: {config.name}, URLs: {len(config.start_urls)}')
"
```

#### Start Crawling
```bash
# Start crawl workflow
docker compose exec web python manage.py start_crawl_workflow \
  --session-id 1 \
  --domains lawinfo \
  --states texas california \
  --practice-areas personal-injury car-accident \
  --limit 50
```

#### Check Results
```bash
# View SourceConfigurations
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.crawler.models import SourceConfiguration
configs = SourceConfiguration.objects.all()
for config in configs:
    print(f'ID: {config.id}, Name: {config.name}, Status: {config.status}')
"

# View Lawyers
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.lawyers.models import Lawyer
lawyers = Lawyer.objects.all()
print(f'Total lawyers: {lawyers.count()}')
for lawyer in lawyers[:5]:
    print(f'- {lawyer.company_name} ({lawyer.phone})')
"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test System Setup
```bash
# Test simple config
docker compose exec web python manage.py simple_config --list-options

# Test crawl workflow
docker compose exec web python manage.py start_crawl_workflow \
  --session-id 1 \
  --domains lawinfo \
  --states texas \
  --practice-areas personal-injury \
  --limit 10
```

### RocketReach Playwright Crawl (Pagination) – New Commands

Run web crawl against RocketReach with pagination and page-size control.

```bash
# Basic crawl (headless)
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_web crawl \
  --url "https://rocketreach.co/company?geo%5B%5D=US+>+States&domain=law&start=1&pageSize=10" \
  --start-page 1 --num-pages 1 --page-size 10 --timeout 60 --headless

# Crawl a later page and only 1 page, overriding page size
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_web crawl \
  --url "https://rocketreach.co/company?geo%5B%5D=US+>+States&domain=law&start=1&pageSize=10" \
  --start-page 10 --num-pages 1 --page-size 1 --timeout 90 --headless
```

Diagnostics after crawl (HTML analysis) – prints MAILTO_COUNT, HAS_GET_CONTACT, CARDS, SAMPLE_CARD_ID using the saved snapshots:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py rocketreach_web crawl \
  --url "https://rocketreach.co/company?geo%5B%5D=US+>+States&domain=law&start=1&pageSize=10" \
  --start-page 10 --num-pages 1 --page-size 1 --timeout 90 --headless \
  --debug-analyze-snapshots
```

This flag reads the latest saved snapshot (e.g., `rocketreach_employees_page.html`) from the project root and prints:
- MAILTO_COUNT and up to 10 `mailto:` links
- HAS_GET_CONTACT (presence of "Get Contact Info")
- CARDS count and a SAMPLE_CARD_ID

### Test Data Quality
```bash
# Check data quality scores
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.lawyers.models import Lawyer
lawyers = Lawyer.objects.all()
for lawyer in lawyers:
    print(f'{lawyer.company_name}: Completeness={lawyer.completeness_score}, Quality={lawyer.quality_score}')
"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker container not starting**:
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   docker compose ps
   
   # Check logs
